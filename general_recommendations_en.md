# general documentation recommendations for trainees and students

A) Before you create your documentation, you should clarify the following points:

1. What has to be documented (software, hardware, process, errors, tests, etc.)?
2. Who are you writing the documentation for? Do you know your readership? Are they familiar with the content?
3. Which format fits? Think of the readers. They will have to view your documentation later. Perhaps they even have to edit it, if necessary.
4. Think about the storage location. Do all readers have access to the file?
5. Is there a company-specific template?

B) How to design your documentation:

1. Make sure that the reader needs as little time as possible to read. All the necessary information should still be included.
2. Decide which information is absolutely necessary and must be included.
3. What information can you omit? Check what the reader doesn't necessarily need.
4. Write a short introduction to quickly explain to the reader what the documentation is about and whether it is relevant to him.
5. Use consistent formatting.
6. Decide on a structure (headlines, table of contents). Keep the structure while writing to create consistency.
7. Use meaningful headlines. They should show exactly what the following section is about. The headlines guide the reader through your documentation like a “red thread”.
8. Make sure that a sentence corresponds exactly to one thought.
9. Write short but concise sentences.
10. Don't embellish your sentences with filler words to avoid unnecessarily long sentences.
11. Choose the terminology according to your readers. Think about whether you should use technical or business (process) terms.
12. If you use abbreviations, write them out the first time you use them. You can then use the abbreviations. This does not apply to common abbreviations such as "e.g.". 
13. If necessary, write a glossary to make it easier for the reader to use the abbreviations.
14. Avoid slang. Be factual while writing.
15. Pay attention to your spelling and commas. Enable spell checking, if available.
16. Use illustrations to show facts easily and quickly.
17. Explain illustrations if you use them.
18. Read your text out loudly and pay attention to whether you have difficulties reading certain parts of the text. Such parts could also be difficult for the reader or interrupt the flow of reading.

C) Coordinate your documentation with your supervisor before publication.

D) Share your documentation with all relevant people.
